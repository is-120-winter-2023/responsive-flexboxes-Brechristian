        <h2>The Conspiracies Begin</h2>
        <p> The Maya Classic Period from AD 800-AD 950 ended in such a confusing manner as to become one of the world's
          greatest mysteries. In a period of 150 years, nearly all the major Maya cities were abandoned and
          archeologists can’t account for what happened to 95% of the 20 million Maya living at the time. The events
          leading up to that point and the society afterward paints a confusing picture that have caused many to
          speculate for decades.
        </p>
        <p>What would have caused the Maya to suddenly abandon their way of living and their great cities? Many
          scenarios have been put forth to try to figure out what caused such a drastic change. The speculations range
          anywhere from climate change to alien abduction.</p>
      </div>
    </article>
    <aside>
      <h2> Alien Abduction</h2>
      <p>Those with a more open way of thinking came up with their own explanation. They point out that one of the
        greatest cities Tikal was built in the celestial shape of the Pleiades constellation. This constellation is
        important because most people who report getting abducted by aliens claim that they were from this
        constellation. Using the Maya long count calendar as evidence, these theorists show that the year AD 830 was
        meant to be a monumental and celebratory year for the Maya. However, in the year AD 830, there was no
        celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of a celebration is very telling to archeologists. The Maya were not known to forget. But some believe
        that the long calendar was truly a countdown that ended in the year AD 830. When a person asks a modern Maya
        what happened to the people anciently, they reply that they went home. The theory is that they prepared and went
        home to the Pleiades constellation by mass alien abduction.

        <h2>Revolution</h2>
      </div>
    </article>
    <p>One of the early accepted theories was brought forth by archeologist Eric Thompson. He believed that the farmers
      and regular folk of the cities incited a rebellion against the royalty. For decades, this was the leading theory.
      That is until it was found that there was no evidence of such a revolt and it would have had to occur
      simultaneously in many competing states, spread across such a large region. There is also no account for those
      that died, and no new society rose from the old as civil wars usually induce. </p>
    <p>However, one possibility that still makes this theory plausible is if the situation was dire enough that the
      people lost faith in the royalty’s ability to communicate with the gods or showed themselves incapable of being
      protectors. 90% of the population were farmers and could have rebelled against the elites and simply abandoned the
      city afterwards. Without evidence, it is still unlikely, but possible.
    </p>

      that
      the long calendar was truly a countdown that ended in the year AD 830. When a person asks a modern Maya what
      happened to the people anciently, they reply that they went home. The theory is that they prepared and went home
      to
      the Pleiades constellation by mass alien abduction.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <h2>Famine</h2>
      <p>The main crop grown by the Maya was always maize (corn). It was a sacred food that they believed to be an
        extension of the Maize God himself, one of their most prominent deities. To the Maya, a life without maize is a
        life without the gods. Without maize, the food supply and religion would crumble. This is exactly what James L.
        Brewbaker proposed took place. In his book “Diseases of Maize in the Wet Lowland Tropics and the Collapse of the
        Classic Maya Civilization,” he conjectures that a disease known as maize mosaic virus (MMV) may have been spread
        among the Maya nation and made the maize inedible.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is believed that sometime before the collapse of the Classic Period, strong winds brought peregrinus maidis
        from the Caribbean to the Maya territory, bringing MMV with them. Without maize, the large population in all the
        cities would have been found with nearly no food to sustain themselves, and no maize to make a connection with
        their gods. The results would have been catastrophic.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <aside>
      <h2>Drought</h2>
      <p>Scientists wished to study the climate changes from AD 800-AD 950 to see if there was a correlation. To
        accomplish this, they drilled into the bottom of lakes and took out sediment cores to study the layers during
        this time period. In the cores they found a layer of gypsum. Gypsum dissolves in water and is carried in by
        rivers. The gypsum layer was found to be from 800 to 1000 AD. They discovered that the Maya region had endured a
        major drought from 750–1025 AD.
      </p>
      <p>Evidence supports this theory because the only places where people seemed to have survived were where the water
        source was deep underground lakes called cenotes, or there was a shallow water table. Archeologists have also
        found organized sacrifices in many of these cenotes, but now buried under thirty or forty feet of water. For the
        Maya to have created them, the water level would have to have been very low. </p>
      <p>A drought would have caused a food shortage, making for weaker people. It would have been easy for them to
        become sick in this state. With no water to wash away human waste, diseased insects would have gathered at the
        cities. Between them and the waste, the Maya could have easily become sick with any number of diseases.</p>
      <p>It appears that the faith that existed before was diminished in the Post-classic Period. The Maize God, which
        had previously been the main deity, was not revered as he once was. Even before the Maya world collapsed, the
        kings started to dress as warriors more frequently than as the Maize God. In the Postclassic puuc style, the
        deity most commonly found on the friezes of the temples was the Rain God Chac. References to him in the Classic
        Period were few and far between, but he soon became the focus of the Maya, feeding into the drought theory. </p>
      <p>Scientific evidence does prove that the Maya civilization suffered a drought during these years. However, one
        must also wonder if the great Maya people who had created their own written language, mathematics, architecture,
        precise way of keeping time, and culture would have fallen simply because of a drought. Would they have found a
        way to survive? </p>

        <h2>Over-Population</h2>
        <p>Archeologists have made discoveries that lead us to believe that the population was larger than originally
          thought. Their cities were enormous and housed tens of thousands, if not more. This could have easily put a
          greater strain on the ruling families during a time that was already difficult with drought and famine.
          Perhaps it was no longer possible to live in the cities.

        <h2>Deforestation</h2>
      </div>
    </article>
    <p>Coupled with the drought is deforestation. Researchers have looked into the environment surrounding the
      cities and made astonishing discoveries. The Maya were chopping down trees and burning large amounts of wood
      at a climbing rate. It appears that they were clearing the land for agricultural purposes and burning massive
      amounts of wood to create the lime plaster for their buildings. It’s estimated that they burned 20 trees per
      square meter.
    </p>
    <p>What they didn’t know is that less water evaporates from its surface from cleared land, which causes there to
      be fewer clouds and less rainfall. In other words, the Maya were making a bad situation worse.
    </p>
    <p>Deforestation also typically decreases the amount of water in the soil, causing problems with crop
      production. The soil would have been depleted of its minerals, becoming virtually useless to farmers. Again,
      the Maya were hurting themselves while trying to fix the problem, though this time they made the famine worse
      as well as the drought. </p>

      Perhaps the Maya society had only been weakened by the drought and would have survived if it hadn’t been for
      foreign invasion. That is what some archeologists believe happened back then. Much as when Teotihuacan marched
      on and conquered Tikal centuries before, some think a foreign power came in and initiated a war, causing the
      Maya civilization to collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is fewer evidence to support this idea than a large war on this scale should have left. However, the
      evidence does exist. At some cities and most notably the city of Ceibal, there are artifacts to suggest this
      history took place. For example, a figure is depicted with a “non-Mayan mustache and hairstyle but who is
      wearing Maya costume” and is known as Wat’ul. Glyphs are found that aren’t from the Maya, as well as a sketched
      person with the mask of Ehecatl, which is not a Maya god but the god of wind from central Mexico. Some Fine
      Orange pottery was also discovered, which is not native to the Maya region.
    </p>

      <h2>Contention & War Between Cities</h2>
      <p>
        It is no secret that the cities sometimes fought amongst themselves and waged war with one another. However, it
        was rarely done. But there are hints in the changes made over the centuries. Frescoes and carvings become more
        violent the closer they are to the end of the Classic Period. Previously, human sacrifice was a rare occasion
        and mainly consisted of members of royalty from other cities that had been conquered. Regardless, in the Temple
        of Frescoes, the king Yajaw Chan Mawan is shown participating in large wars, taking captives, sacrificing them,
        and having more bloodletting rituals. This as well as other finds causes archaeologists to assume that the Maya
        had become a more militaristic people and perhaps were desperate for the gods to hear their plea.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is known that the cities did have skirmishes during this time. Large numbers of arrowheads have been found
        around sites and cities were constructing walls, presumably with the intention of keeping others out. There was
        also a recent research project that revealed new information on Maya war tactics. While studying a sediment
        core, scientists discovered a surprisingly inch thick layer of charcoal, suggesting that there was a very large
        fire nearby. However this layer was “unlike any other natural fire recorded in the lake's sediment.” This
        implies that the nearby city of Witzna was the victim of scorched-earth military tactics, which was previously
        thought to not have been used by the Maya.
      </p>
      <p>
        When tested by scientists, they learned that each monument in the city of Witzna did indeed show signs of
        burning. The mysterious part is that the charcoal layer says that this took place sometime from AD 690-AD 700
        and is later connected to a burning emblem in the city of Naranjo, which says that it burned the city of Bahlam
        Jol (the Maya name for Wtizna) on May 21, AD 697. In the very same war statement at Naranjo, it references
        burning three other cities. This was a full century before the decline of the Classic Period. The Maya were
        still at the height of their civilization, yet behaving in this manner toward each other.
